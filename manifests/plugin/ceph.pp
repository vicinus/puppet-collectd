#== Class: collectd::plugin::ceph
#
# Class to manage ceph plugin for collectd
# === Parameters
# [*ensure*]
#   ensure param for collectd::plugin type
#
# [*daemons*]
#   array of ceph daemons to create config for (replace clustername, hostname as appropriate)
#   example: [ '[clustername]-osd.1', '[clustername]-osd.2', '[clustername]-osd.3', '[clustername]-mon.[hostname].asok' ]
#
#
# [*longrunavglatency*] If enabled, latency values(sum,count pairs) are
#   calculated as the long run average - average since the ceph daemon was
#   started = (sum / count). i When disabled, latency values are calculated as
#   the average since the last collection = (sum_now - sum_last) / (count_now -
#   count_last).
#
# [*convertspecialmetrictypes*}
#   If enabled, special metrics (metrics that differ in type from similar
#   counters) are converted to the type of those similar counters.  This
#   currently only applies to filestore.journal_wr_bytes which is a counter for
#   OSD daemons. The ceph schema reports this metric type as a sum,count pair i
#   while similar counters are treated as derive types. When converted, the sum
#   is used as the counter value and is treated as a derive type. When
#   disabled, all metrics are treated as the types received from the ceph
#   schema.
#
# [*manage_package*]
#   If enabled, manages separate package for plugin
#
# [*package_name*]
#   to be used with manage_package; if manage_package is true, this gives the name
#   of the package to manage. Defaults to 'collectd-ceph'
#
